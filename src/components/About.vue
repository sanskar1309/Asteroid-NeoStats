      Welcome to the Asteroid Neo Stats project, where we bring you the latest
      data on asteroids passing near Earth. Our mission is to provide accurate
      and up-to-date information on near-Earth objects (NEOs) using NASAâ€™s NeoWs
      API.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project features an intuitive interface where you can select a date
      range to view detailed statistics on asteroids that have come close to
      Earth. With interactive charts and easy-to-read data, we aim to make
      asteroid tracking accessible and informative for everyone.
